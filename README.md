# Unlicense template

![logo](icon.png)

[Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/) is one of my favourite FOSS licences. Due
to retarded copyright laws in many countries you are not legally allowed
to release your work to public domain. Unlicense uses copyright waiver that
contributors must sign to work around this issue.

This is repository template I'll use to create new projects in the future.

## Usage

Copy everything except README.md and icon.png (unless you like it) to new repository.

- AUTHORS - replace "John Doe" with your name (obviously...) All contributors
must append their copyright waiver to this file
- CONTRIBUTING - contains description how to contribute. If you prefer other
method of signing copyright waiver (gpg, empty commit) you must describe this here
- LICENSE - contains text of licenses. Don't trust me - check here: https://unlicense.org/
